# Temporary workaround for VC on Aliucord

- Download [this .zip](https://nightly.link/omardotdev/aliucar/workflows/build/feat%2Fvc/build.zip?status=completed)
- Extract it and find `Aliucord.zip` inside it
- Move `Aliucord.zip` to your `Aliucord` folder ([video tutorial](https://streamable.com/dj705w))
- Open Aliucord settings
- Enable [Developer Mode](https://files.catbox.moe/10707n.jpg) & [Aliucord from storage](https://files.catbox.moe/lruiyx.jpg)
- Restart Aliucord

If that didn't work, make sure your Aliucord is updated through [Manager](https://github.com/Aliucord/Manager/releases/download/v1.1.1/aliucord-manager-v1.1.1.apk)

If you are sure it's already updated but still doesn't work, install [ForceAliucordZip](https://github.com/OmegaSunkey/awesomeplugins/raw/builds/ForceAliucordZip.zip) plugin:
- Disable `Aliucord from storage` option
- Download the [plugin .zip](https://github.com/OmegaSunkey/awesomeplugins/raw/builds/ForceAliucordZip.zip)
- Move the plugin `.zip` to the `Aliucord/plugins` folder
- Restart Aliucord two times

This plugin makes the `Aliucord.zip` work without need to enable `Aliucord from storage`, which seems broken on some devices
